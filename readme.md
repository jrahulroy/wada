Purpose 
=======
Develop a highly interactive and presentable web interface or simply a great UI to communicate with backend databases and fetch requested data.

Product Scope 
=============
The purpose of this WA (Web App ) is to enable Web users to fetch their data needs from processed data stores in the datacentres.

Existing System
===============
There are many Open Source Database Servers, and small database Servers such as MySQL that are feature effective in comparison with the commercial products, but they lack an user interface for accessing and executing queries. 
There are some applications where we may need access to database in a Web Context, and some applications require to access huge database that may contain millions of rows. Such accesses should be handled neatly and effectively.

Proposed System
===============
We propose a Web Application that can run in Web Context (Client Browsers), can access remote Database, effectively handle million rows, Dynamic enough, to be able to accommodate in the changes in the database.
